* Emacs Presentation Mode

Present your Emacs sessions with readable text across every buffer, while keeping a quick toggle and hooks for tailoring the UI during demos.

** What this package provides
- A global minor mode (~presentation-mode~) that applies ~text-scale-mode~ across all buffers/windows for easier screen-sharing or live demos.
- Explicit on/off toggle with lighter, plus hooks (~presentation-on-hook~, ~presentation-off-hook~) to adjust your UI during presentations (e.g., hide line numbers, switch completion UI).
- Optional delegation to Emacs 29’s ~global-text-scale-adjust~ for synchronized scaling while keeping the above toggle and hooks.

** How to use
 1. Execute ~M-x presentation-mode~ to start the presentation.
 2. Adjust scale size by ~C-x C-+~ or ~C-x C--~
    See https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Text-Scale.html
 3. After the presentation, execute ~M-x presentation-mode~ again.
 4. And then execute ~M-x presentation-mode~ again, the last scale will be reproduced.
 5. If you want to persistize its size as the default size of presentation-mode
    after restarting Emacs, set ~presentation-default-text-scale~.

** Notice
*** Not for "persistent font size change"
It is well known that how to change the font size of Emacs in GUI is difficult.
However, this mode is *NOT* intended for permanent font size change.

*** About ~global-text-scale-adjust~ (Emacs 29+, non-persistent)
- Emacs 29 ships ~global-text-scale-adjust~; it synchronizes scaling across windows but does not persist font size between sessions.
- Try it first if you only need quick, global scaling. Continue here when you need explicit on/off control or hooks for presentation-specific tweaks.

** Customization
You can switch modes for screen decoration by defining hook for on/off.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-presentation-on ()
  (vertico-mode -1)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode -1)
  (fido-mode 1)
  (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
  (modus-themes-select 'modus-vivendi))

(defun my-presentation-off ()
  (fido-mode -1)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode 1)
  (vertico-mode 1)
  (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
  (modus-themes-select 'modus-operandi))

(add-hook 'presentation-on-hook #'my-presentation-on)
(add-hook 'presentation-off-hook #'my-presentation-off)
#+END_SRC
Typically it is on/off of ~display-line-numbers-mode~ (or ~linum-mode~) /(although I do not use it)/.
I normally use [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]], but I think that [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html][IDO]] is more compact and easy to see during presentation.

*** Global scaling (Emacs 29+)
- Emacs 29 added ~global-text-scale-adjust~ in ~face-remap.el~. When available, ~presentation-mode~ delegates scaling to it so all frames/windows stay in sync.
- Control delegation with ~presentation-use-global-text-scale-adjust~:
  - ~auto~ (default): use global adjust when available and no ignored buffers need protection.
  - ~always~: force global adjust when available (no fallback for ignored buffers).
  - ~never~: always use the legacy buffer-local ~text-scale-mode~ behavior.
- If any buffer should be excluded (e.g., matches ~presentation-mode-ignore-minor-modes~ or has ~presentation-disable~ set), delegation is disabled in ~auto~ mode and buffer-local scaling is used to keep those buffers unchanged.
** Difference from other methods
*** vs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GlobalTextScaleMode][GlobalTextScaleMode]] (Emacs Wiki)
Although the content of this article is simple, it does not provide a way to recover buffers.
*** vs [[https://github.com/takaxp/moom][moom]]
~moom~ package has flexible frame control and font size change function.
Its font size change function is controlled by a mechanism different from ~presentation.el~.
*** vs [[https://github.com/purcell/default-text-scale][default-text-scale]]
~default-text-scale~ package is an implementation that replaces ~text-scale-mode~.
This package is probably not compatible with ~presentation.el~, but please use this whenever you want to synchronize font size at all times, not only for presentation use.
*** vs [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][Org Tree Slide]] and [[https://github.com/rlister/org-present][org-present]]
These packages are simple presentations using org-mode.
By using these with org-babel, it may be possible to perform live coding of arbitrary languages.
*** vs global-text-scale-adjust (Emacs 29+)
- If you only want to synchronize text scale across all windows, a simple remap can suffice:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key map [remap text-scale-adjust] #'global-text-scale-adjust)
  #+END_SRC
- ~presentation-mode~ adds value when you need explicit on/off toggling via a minor mode and custom hooks (~presentation-on-hook~, ~presentation-off-hook~) to adjust UI (e.g., hide line numbers, switch completion UI) during presentations.
