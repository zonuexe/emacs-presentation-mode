* Emacs Presentation Mode
Present your Emacs sessions with readable text across all buffers, featuring a quick toggle and hooks for tailoring your UI during live demos.

[!TIP]
** Note on the February 2026 Update
The scaling engine was significantly updated on 2026-02-01.  See [[https://github.com/zonuexe/emacs-presentation-mode/pull/4][PR #4]] for details and rollback instructions.  Your feedback is very welcome!
#+END_QUOTE

** Key Features
- *Global Scaling*: A global minor mode (~presentation-mode~) that scales text across all windows for crystal-clear screen sharing.
- *UI Automation*: Use hooks (~presentation-on-hook~ / ~off-hook~) to automatically adjust your environment (e.g., hide line numbers, switch themes).
- *Emacs 29+ Ready*: Optionally delegates to native ~global-text-scale-adjust~ while maintaining toggle and hook support.
- *Persistence*: Automatically remembers and restores your last used scale.

** How to use
 1. Execute ~M-x presentation-mode~ to start your session.
 2. Adjust the scale using ~C-x C-+~ or ~C-x C--~.
    (Reference: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Text-Scale.html][Emacs Manual: Text Scale]])
 3. Toggle ~M-x presentation-mode~ again to stop and restore your original UI.
 4. When re-enabled, the mode automatically reproduces your last used scale.
 5. To set a permanent starting scale, customize ~presentation-default-text-scale~.
** Technical Notes
*** Not for permanent font configuration
This mode is *NOT* intended for permanent font size changes. For global font configuration, refer to:
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Parameter-Access.html][Access to Frame Parameters (Elisp Manual)]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Frame-Parameters.html][Frame Parameters (Emacs Manual)]]
*** Emacs 29+ Global Scaling
Emacs 29 introduced ~global-text-scale-adjust~. This package can delegate to it while providing the extra benefit of hooks and persistence.
- Control delegation via ~presentation-use-global-text-scale-adjust~:
  - ~auto~ (default): uses global adjust when available and no buffers are ignored.
  - ~always~: forces global adjust.
  - ~never~: always uses the legacy buffer-local ~text-scale-mode~.
** Customization
Use hooks to define a "Presentation Theme" that triggers automatically.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-presentation-on ()
  "Setup UI for presentations."
  (vertico-flat-mode -1)
  ;; (global-display-line-numbers-mode -1)
  (modus-themes-select 'modus-vivendi))

(defun my-presentation-off ()
  "Restore UI after presentations."
  (vertico-flat-mode 1)
  ;; (global-display-line-numbers-mode 1)
  (modus-themes-select 'modus-operandi))

(add-hook 'presentation-on-hook #'my-presentation-on)
(add-hook 'presentation-off-hook #'my-presentation-off)
#+END_SRC
Typically it is on/off of ~display-line-numbers-mode~ (or ~linum-mode~) /(although I do not use it)/.
I normally use [[https://github.com/emacs-straight/vertico][Vertico]]; with ~vertico-flat-mode~ candidates stay on one horizontal line, minimizing vertical space during live demos. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html][IDO]] / ~fido-mode~ is another compact built-in UI option.
*** Global scaling (Emacs 29+)
- Emacs 29 added ~global-text-scale-adjust~ in ~face-remap.el~. When available, ~presentation-mode~ delegates scaling to it so all frames/windows stay in sync.
- Control delegation with ~presentation-use-global-text-scale-adjust~:
  - ~auto~ (default): use global adjust when available and no ignored buffers need protection.
  - ~always~: force global adjust when available (no fallback for ignored buffers).
  - ~never~: always use the legacy buffer-local ~text-scale-mode~ behavior.
- If any buffer should be excluded (e.g., matches ~presentation-mode-ignore-minor-modes~ or has ~presentation-disable~ set), delegation is disabled in ~auto~ mode and buffer-local scaling is used to keep those buffers unchanged.
** Difference from other methods
*** vs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GlobalTextScaleMode][GlobalTextScaleMode]] (Emacs Wiki)
Although the content of this article is simple, it does not provide a way to recover buffers.
*** vs [[https://github.com/takaxp/moom][moom]]
~moom~ package has flexible frame control and font size change function.
Its font size change function is controlled by a mechanism different from ~presentation.el~.
*** vs [[https://github.com/purcell/default-text-scale][default-text-scale]]
~default-text-scale~ package is an implementation that replaces ~text-scale-mode~.
This package is probably not compatible with ~presentation.el~, but please use this whenever you want to synchronize font size at all times, not only for presentation use.
*** vs [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][Org Tree Slide]] and [[https://github.com/rlister/org-present][org-present]]
These packages are simple presentations using org-mode.
By using these with org-babel, it may be possible to perform live coding of arbitrary languages.
*** vs global-text-scale-adjust (Emacs 29+)
- If you only want to synchronize text scale across all windows, a simple remap can suffice:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key global-map [remap text-scale-adjust] #'global-text-scale-adjust)
  #+END_SRC
- ~presentation-mode~ adds value when you need explicit on/off toggling via a minor mode and custom hooks (~presentation-on-hook~, ~presentation-off-hook~) to adjust UI (e.g., hide line numbers, switch completion UI) during presentations.
*** Comparison with Alternatives
| Feature           | presentation.el | global-text-scale | default-text-scale |
|-------------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------|
| Global Scaling    | Yes             | Yes               | Yes                |
| UI Hooks (On/Off) | *Yes*           | No                | No                 |
| Scale Persistence | Yes             | No                | Yes                |
| Buffer Exclusion  | Yes             | No                | No                 |
- *vs Org-specific tools* (~org-tree-slide~, ~org-present~): These are for slide decks. ~presentation.el~ is for general live-coding and demoing any buffer.
- *vs default-text-scale*: Use ~default-text-scale~ for permanent global scaling. Use ~presentation.el~ for temporary presentation mode with environment tweaks.
